[Project Title] Empire
[Tools] Unity-C#-Illustrator-Photoshop
[Platforms] Windows/OSX

DESIGN :
    [ ] Real time or turn based ? @critical 
    [ ] Retaliation system @critical
    [ ] Prevent player from abusing the in-deal-territories-are-easier-to-take-over feature
        Deals have to be respected during a certain period of time ?
        New deals can't be made with that territory ?
        Retaliation ?
    [ ] Threat system
        Gauge slowly filling over time
        Bribe authorities to slow down or decrease gauge
        Spending cash increases threat gauge (bank spendings are safe)

    [ ] Dept system on deals that can't be honored
        Retaliation ?
    [ ] Attack with crew (Risk)

FEATURES:
    [ ] Regroup all gameplay settings in single objects for easy swap @started(20-06-16 16:45)
        Mainly to allow alternate settings when testing turn based system
    [ ] Cancelled deal trigger retaliation
        In deal territory might attack player-controlled neighbors
        All neighbor territories ? Random (multiple) territories ?
        Same odds or Advantage on success for rival ?
    [ ] Deal negociation @low
        Risk system : negociation creates risks overtime with those territories
        An deal without negociation is a deal without risks ?
    [ ] Large numbers @high
    [ ] Tutorials
    [ ] Pop up events @low
    [ ] Formula for threat increment by cash spent @high
        Random events + threat events
        Resource modifiers + temporary buff/debuffs
    [ ] Structures upgrade level on hover

BUGFIX:
    [ ] Resources from int to long
        Or non-realistic resource values ? e.g Civilization
    [ ] Visual feedback on threat generated by failed take over
